        Here we change two messages from the same sniff. Note how the
        codes are slightly different because the sniff developer has
        defined both a MaxExceeded message and a TooLong message. In the
        case of this sniff, one is used for warnings and one is used
        for errors.

        <message>Line contains %2$s chars, which is more than the limit of %1$s</message>

    <!--
       Some sniffs have public member vars that allow you to
       customise specific elements of the sniff. In the case of
       the Generic LineLength sniff, you can customise the limit
       at which the sniff will throw warnings and the limit at
       which it will throw errors.

       The rule below includes the LineLength sniff but changes the
       settings so the sniff will show warnings for any line longer
       than 90 chars and errors for any line longer than 100 chars.
